Hint 1: if sum is odd we can't make equal subset sum partition
Hint 2: we are dividing it into 2 set so the** sum = set1+set2** and we know that **set1 == set2 **so **sum = 2 time of set1** or **set1 = sum/2**.
Hint 3: now you have to find only sum/2 now the problem is like find** subset of sum k**.
